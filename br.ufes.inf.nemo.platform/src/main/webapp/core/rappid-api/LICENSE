Additional term: Attribution
----------------------------

(a) As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of
the Original Code ("Original Developer"), in the hope that its promotional value may help 
justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original Code, the Original Developer 
may include in Exhibit A ("Attribution Information") a requirement that each time an Executable 
and Source Code or a Larger Work is launched or initially run (which includes initiating a session), 
a prominent display of the Original Developer's Attribution Information (as defined below) must 
occur on the graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such Covered Code 
(which may include display on a splash screen), if any. The size of the graphic image should 
be consistent with the size of the other elements of the Attribution Information. 
If the access by the end user to the Executable and Source Code does not create a graphic 
user interface for access to the Covered Code, this obligation shall not apply. 
If the Original Code displays such Attribution Information in a particular form 
(such as in the form of a splash screen, notice at login, an "about" display, or dedicated 
attribution area on user interface screens), continued use of such form for that 
Attribution Information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice.

(b) Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief phrase, 
graphic image and a URL ("Attribution Information") and is subject to the Attribution Limits 
as defined below. For these purposes, prominent shall mean display for sufficient duration 
to give reasonable notice to the user of the identity of the Original Developer and that 
if You include Attribution Information or similar information for other parties, 
You must ensure that the Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall be no 
less prominent than such Attribution Information or similar information for the other party. 
For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to specify in Exhibit A below 
that the above attribution requirement only applies to an Executable and Source Code 
resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a Larger Work. 
The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Original Developer 
cannot require that You display, at any time, more than the following information 
as Attribution Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Original Developer; 
(b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image provided by 
the Original Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the "Attribution Limits").

(c) If Exhibit A does not include any Attribution Information, then there are no requirements 
for You to display any Attribution Information of the Original Developer.

(d) You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names contained 
within the Attribution Information distributed with the Covered Code are the exclusive property 
of their owners and may only be used with the permission of their owners, or under circumstances 
otherwise permitted by law or as expressly set out in this License.
